                                Thanks to the data gathered with the Plerdy heatmap about your website visitors’ behavior, you can generate hypotheses that potentially explain which functional flaws and problems are causing a low conversion on your website and how.

                                Some services disregard such an important aspect as the clickability analysis of the dynamic elements when UX auditing, including drop-down menu, pop-up, and slider. However, thanks to the unique Plerdy auditing functionality, you will receive this information.

                            <div class="slide-text">
                                In some areas, websites generate more than 60% of the traffic from their mobile versions, so it would be unwise not to audit the behavior of mobile users. With the Plerdy heatmap, you can run a UX auditing analysis separately for the desktop and mobile versions of your website.

                            <div class="slide-text">
                                In addition to the Plerdy heatmap data, you also get the audit data from Google Analytics. Thus, you can analyze the sources of traffic and its quality to be able to pinpoint any problems. For example, fixing usability bugs alone will not improve conversion if the website gets mistargeted traffic.
